<html>  Welcome to the Latin Quizzer tutorial. This is meant to give you a basic grasp of latin<br> grammar and help you identify and translate Latin successfully. This basic lesson will<br>focus on verbs in the present tense. There are 6 different cases possible in both English <br>and Latin for a verb. They are as follows:<br> <table border="1"><tr><td>1st Singular: I </td><td>2nd Singular: You</td><td>3rd Singular: He/She/It</td></tr><tr><td>1st Plural: We </td><td>2nd Plural: You(pl) </td><td>3rd Plural: They </td></tr></table> <br>It is fairly simple to recognize the case of a verb in latin based on its ending. Similar to French,<br> Latin has specific endings that can be used to recognize the use of the verb. They are as follows:<br><table border="1"><tr><td>1st Singular : -o</td><td>2nd Singular: -s</td><td>3rd Singular: t</td></tr><tr><td>1st Plural: -mus</td><td>2nd Plural: -tis</td><td>3rd Plural: -nt</td></tr></table><br>For example, the verb <b><i>vocat</i></b> means he/she/it calls. It is as easy as that!<br>One of the only verbs that differs from this pattern is the verb ¡°to be¡±. Here are the proper<br> translations for it:<br><table border="1"><tr><td>1st Singular : sum</td><td>2nd Singular: es</td><td>3rd Singular: et</td></tr><tr><td>1st Plural: summus</td><td>2nd Plural: estis</td><td>3rd Plural: sunt</td></tr></table></html>
<html>Nouns in the present tense have 3 declensions. Each declension has different endings based on the use of the noun. The 2 uses<br> that will be taught today are nominative and accusative. Nominative means that that noun is the doer of the action, while the <br>accusative is the receiver of it. Here are the nominative and accusative endings for the first 3 declensions:<br><table border="1"><tr><td>1st Declention:</td><td>Nomintive singular: -a</td><td>Nominative plural: -ae</td><td>Accusative singular: -am</td><td>Accusative plural: -as</td></tr><tr><td>2nd Declention:</td><td>Nomintive singular: -us</td><td>Nominative plural: -i</td><td>Accusative singular: -um</td><td>Accusative plural: -os</td></tr><tr><td>3rd Declention:</td><td>Nomintive singular: anything else</td><td>Nominative plural: -es</td><td>Accusative singular: -em</td><td>Accusative plural: -es</td></tr></table><br>For example, the noun servus which means slave, is nominative singular. This means that one slave is performing a certain action.<br>To put it all together let¡¯s translate the sentence ¡°servus matrem vocat.¡± You already know that servus is in nominative singular,<br> and that vocat is in 3rd person singular. The word matrem is a root for an english word. Maternal means motherly, and therefore<br> matrem means mother. If you look up at the list, the case for matrem is in the third declension under accusative singular. <br>So if we put it all together, the final translation is The slave (servus) calls (vocat) the mother (matrem).
