<html>Kinematics is a branch of physics that studies the world of motion<br>Since this is ideal land, all the motion can be assume frictionless and runs perfectly base on assumptions, and the acceleration are always constant<br><br>There are 5 variables within Kinematics:<br>Initial velocity: The initial change of speed within the motion (vi)<br>Final velocity: The final change of speed within the motion (vf)<br>Time: The amount of time for the motion(t)<br>Acceleration: The change of velocity within the motion (a)<br>Displacement: The change of position of the object(d)<br><br>In the world of Kinematics, everything is dictated by the following 5 formulas:<br>vf=vi+a*t<br>d=0.5(vi+vf)*t<br>d=vi*t + 0.5*a*t^2<br>d=vf*t - 0.5*a*t^2<br>vf^2 = vi^2 + 2*a*d<br>With the following tools on hand, let's explore the world of kinematics, along with the midnight driver!</html>
