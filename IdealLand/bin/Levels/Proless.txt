<html>The key idea for projectile motion is that the motion of the x dymension is completely ueffected by the y dimension<br>Meaning, no matter how strong the gravity is, it will never effiect the x dimension of the motion<br>however, the stronger gravity are, the stronger it's effect towards the y dimension<br><br>When approaching a projectile motion problem, first thing to remember is:<br>Although they are two separate motions, they share the same time<br>The apporach is to divide up the motion into it's x and y component using the following formular:<br>x = v*cos(angle), y =v*sin(angle)<br>Then repersent both motion in the fundamental kinematics equations<br>Then solve for the unknowns using the advantage that time stays the same<br>Let's go and "inspire" Newton</html>
